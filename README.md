<h1>AI/ML Tasks: Let's Build Together</h1>
<p>It's time to dive into some hands-on learning! We’ve combined basic and intermediate tasks into a single, impactful challenge. Follow the steps and challenge yourself!</p>

<h2>Step 1:</h2>
<p>Start by learning Git/GitHub and version control from the link below:</p>

<h2>Step 2: Your Task - Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge</h2>

<h3>Model Building & Evaluation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Train a <strong>logistic regression model</strong> to predict taxi fares. You can choose another regression technique if it suits your dataset better.</li>
    <li>After training, evaluate your model’s performance using a <strong>confusion matrix</strong> (or any other relevant evaluation metrics) to ensure accuracy between <strong>97-100%</strong>.</li>
    <li>Fine-tune and improve your model’s predictions by experimenting with hyperparameters and adding regularization techniques.</li>
    <li>Visualize your model's predictions and evaluation metrics in a graph to showcase the results effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fork the repository.</li>
    <li>Create a folder with your name.</li>
    <li>Add your project files (code, model, visualizations, etc.) and commit the changes.</li>
    <li>Create a pull request once everything is in place.</li>
    <li>After completing the task, provide the link to your GitHub repository.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Get to Work & Have Fun!</h2>
<p>This challenge in AI/ML is your chance to dive deep into the project. Explore, experiment, and see just how much you can improve your model’s accuracy!</p>
